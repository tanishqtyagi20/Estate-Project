# Capstone-Project
Dwello is a static real estate website built using only HTML and CSS as part of a Semester 1 capstone project. It includes a styled homepage, property listings page, login page, and contact form layout, all designed with a clean and modern interface. Basic responsiveness and aesthetic animations were added to enhance the user experience, and some animation guidance was taken from peers and AI references during development.
